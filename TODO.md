  - Manage multiple campaigns, each with its own set of characters, NPCs, and notes.
  - Timeline feature to track campaign events chronologically.
- Session Notes and Log:
  - Digital notepad for session planning and real-time note-taking.
  - Automatically log session events, dice rolls, and decisions for future reference.
- Maps (others do it much better)
- Audio/video/image library
- Messaging (others do it much better)
- Integration with discord
- Dice roller
- NPC Automatic Generator
